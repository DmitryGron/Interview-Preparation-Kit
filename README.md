# Interview-Preparation-Kit

Some backstory. After my first serious interview I have accumulated a bit of resources that I thought were useful for others to use. This is a try to get them classified and sorted.

## CV

The first thing to do before even interview process starts â€“ prepare your CV and/or linkedin profile. Try to be concise, short and measurable when possible. Grow your network. Set up career interests section and allow InMail.

## Youtube resources

### [Gaurav Sen]

A lot of videos; problems, algo, structures and system design. Sometimes hard to watch cause of camera autozoom. Still worth a try.

### [CS Dojo]

Compact videos on algo, structures, problems.

### [GeeksForGeeks yt]

A lot of resources on problems, contains code solutions.

### [Irfan Baqui]

Whiteboard Thursday good series on how to approach coding questions. Best video resource on interview emulation.

### [Success In Tech]

Good design question breakdown, easy to understand. Good videos on concepts

### HackerRank

Two playlists by Gayle Laakmann McDowell on structures and solving interview questions + algo. Complimentary to the book and some of the challenges on HackerRank.

[Algo playlist]

## Coding websites

### [HackerRank]

One of the best resources to solve problems, learn new things and get the grasp on how web coding editors work (surprise, you should not expect much from them).
decent [compiled problem kit]
[practice problem set]

### [LeetCode]

Basically the same as hackerrank, compares your results to other submissions.

### [GeeksForGeeks]

Contains good amount of interview questions, even by employer. Amazing resource.

### [Pramp]

*Disclaimer: link contains referral for extra credits given to you.*

The **best** so far resource to train phone like coding interview and to get over interview anxiety. Also has multiple different sections such as behavioral questions and system design (not limited to). Strongly recommend to get practice via Pramp. The session is splitted in two parts, in one of them you are interviewer and your partner is interviewee, then you switch sides.
[Couple of yt examples]

### Interviewing.io

Right now is in private beta. Basically should be the same as Pramp, but as I've understood with real engineers volunteering to practice interviews. Still can be used to learn how engineers ask questions / couple of problem solutions.
[Examples]

## System Design

**Perfect** resource on system design by Facebook engineering manager.

## Books

### Cracking the coding interview - Gayle Laakmann McDowell

De-facto standard. Must read before any engineering interview. Contains many problems with solutions.

### Elements of Programming Interviews - Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, and Tsung-Hsien Lee

A bit advanced and different approach compared to Ctci.
<https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/>
<https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge>

### Introduction to Algorithms - Charles E. Leiserson, Clifford Stein, Ronald Rivest, and Thomas H. Cormen

Old but gold.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms>

## Interview Process

Last but not the least part. Many of the things are straightforward, will still list them + couple of resources.

- Use [STAR] method
- Check dress code
- Listen to the interviewer
- Get acquainted with the company public info
- [Typical questions]

### [Dan Croitor]

Good videos on overall interviewing process. Focused more on Amazon and behavioral principles, still can be applied to general engineering positions.
